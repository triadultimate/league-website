This is where we would put all of the information we would want about the different things.

# Annoucements 

* We are having league this summer! Horray!


# To answer your questions.... 

Thank you so much for filling out the interest form earlier! It was great to see the level of excitement there was to get out there and enjoy this sport with friends (old and new). We saw a couple of questions come up a couple of times, so we wanted to address them here:

* Masks...(see COVID protocols below)
* Skill level   
* If a player shows up late to a game because of work can they still play?
    * yep!


# COVID Protocols 

This is then another thing about COVID... what we are doing, what we are not doing

* What safety mesures will be in place for covid? Will vaccines and/or masks be required to play? 
* Will there be face coverings?


## from Buck's example

### General Tenets of League Play

The following items are required by our insurance provider and must be adhered to during league play.

Masks are mandatory while playing and whenever on the sidelines within 6 feet of another individual.

Teams must each have their own sideline; no shared sidelines allowed.

Each sideline will have access to hand sanitizer for players to use between points or at other times when sanitizing hands is prudent.

Tower Grove Park is limiting the number of players to 50 per field. Other than chaperones and childcare providers, we ask that no unnecessary guest/spectators attend.

If there are material changes to guidance issued by the CDC during the registration period, or during the season, the league rules and SLUA COVID Preparedness Plan may be amended to reflect any updates. Any changes will be communicated to all participants in the league. 

We appreciate your cooperation with our game play modifications this summer and look forward to returning to standard league rules and non-modified game play in the near future.
