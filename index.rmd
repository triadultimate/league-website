Wecome to the league 


## Annoucements 

* We are having league this summer! Horray!


## To answer your questions.... 

Thank you so much for filling out the interest form earlier! It was great to see the level of excitement there was to get out there and enjoy this sport with friends (old and new). We saw a couple of questions come up a couple of times, so we wanted to address them here:


* Skill level:
    * We are taking all skill levels and are excited to see Ultimate grow in the Triad area.
    * We will be playing by USAU rules, and the captains are there to help educated and ensure everyone has a good time.
* If a player shows up late to a game because of work can they still play?
    * yep! Just let your captain know so they can plan accordingly.
* Masks...(see COVID protocols below)

## COVID Protocols 

__General Operating Guidelines__  

* Whenever possible, maintain a safe distance and be respectful of people.
* Masks are not required, but you are welcome to wear one if you desire.
* Proof of vaccination is not required, but if you feel sick or test positive, please __stay home__ and __let your captains know__ as soon as possible so that we can ensure we are not spreading diseases.

__Closing Comments__ 

If there are material changes to guidance issued by the CDC during the registration period, or during the season, the league rules  may be amended to reflect any updates. Any changes will be communicated to all participants in the league. 

We appreciate your cooperation with our game play modifications this summer and look forward to returning to standard league rules and non-modified game play in the near future.
