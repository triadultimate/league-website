Hi there!

Thanks for visiting! This is the landing page to give an overview of what we are doing with leagues.

The people currently organizing this mess are:

* Mike Ridge  
* Jess Cheu 
* Phil Walker

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions by sending us email to <triadultimate@gmail.com>


## What are our goals?  

* An inclusive league where players are excited to come back to not only go individually but to see the ultimate community grow in the Triad area.


## How do we plan on meeting them?

* We are working to ensure the decisions made are documented on this site and we are open to receiving feedback.
